Mission Statement
#################


0. Abstract
===========

To provide a simple, flexible, feature-rich, multi-platform, completely free and
open source engine for creating, modifying and powering first and third person
multiplayer voxel-games.


1. Simple
=========

The public facing Lua API should be kept easy to learn and easy to use. New
developers must be able to produce something with only a few lines of code which
are easy to understand when read, and must be able to just as easily modify
already existing code.


2. Flexible
===========

The engine itself should be flexible by not making narrow assumptions about
certain usecases and by not imposing arbitrary limits on its users.


3. Feature-rich
===============

The engine and the public facing Lua API should provide features which allow
to test and implement new ideas.


4. Multi-platform
=================

Minetest should be kept running on as many platforms as feasible. Arbitrary
limitations to its portability must be avoided.


5. Free and open source
=======================

Minetest is provided as free and open source software, with the hope of being
useful.


6. Creation
===========

The main goal of Minetest is to empower developers and users alike to create,
modify and run voxel-games. This is achieved with a solid C++ core which has
a public facing Lua API which is simple and easy to learn and yet flexible.
