0. About
--------

Minetest is a free and open source voxel-game engine, it provides the foundation
for creating, modifying and running multiplayer voxel-games. At its core beats
a C++ engine which is controled with Lua scripts.


1. Multiplayer by default
-------------------------

The very core is designed for multiplayer games, of course one can play offline
and all on their own, but Minetest makes it extremely easy to just start a server
and invite friends over. This comes at no additional cost for the developer,
mods and games for Minetest are automatically single- and multiplayer ready.


2. Moddable by default
----------------------

Minetest games are structured in multiple mods, which are simple directories
which contain the Lua code which is run. A game can consist of one or multiple
mods and the user has always the possibiliy to remove or add additional mods
without much effort.

This also means that Minetest allows you to build your own game by simply adding
the mods that you would like to use, no programming required.


3. Lua and simplicity
---------------------

The combination of Lua and the simplicity of the API make it a joy to use. With
only a few lines of code functionality can be implemented and an existing game
extended. The API allows control over nearly every aspect of the engine, and
getting started with it is as easy as adding a single file and writing a few
lines of Lua.
